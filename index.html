        <h1>The Hawaiian Islands</h1>

        <p>There's no place on earth quite like this chain of sun-drenched, Pacific islands. Here you'll find beautiful blue lagoons, tropical rainforests, hidden gardens, cascading waterfalls, wild rivers running through canyons, and soaring volcanoes. You will also find some of the most fabulous beaches in the world. The possibilities for adventure and relaxation are endless. Each of the six main islands is separate, distinct, and infinitely complex.

        <h3>The Climate</h3>
        
        Hawaii's climate is remains near-constant due to trade winds which blow from the east. Summer highs usually reach around 88 °F during the day and drop to a low of 75 °F at night. Winter day temperatures are usually around 83 °F and fall to a comfortable 65 °F at night.

        
        <h3>The Cuisine</h3>

        For the food lover in all of us, Hawaii offers a wide range of dining options, from fine dining to cheap eats. The options are almost endless. While visiting, why not go local. Try a Plate Lunch. This usually consists of teriyaki beef, chicken or pork cutlet breaded, fried and slathered in rich gravy, two scoops of rice, and cabbage. Other tasty foods include Poke which is an appetizer made up of cubed raw fish seasoned with onions, seaweed and kukui nuts. For desert try a Haupia which is a creamy coconut pudding or a maybe a Shave Ice would hit the spot.
